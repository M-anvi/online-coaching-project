    <h1>HTML<span class="color_h1"> Basic Examples</span></h1>
    <p class="intro">In this chapter we will show some basic HTML examples.</p>
    <h2>HTML Documents</h2>
    <p>All HTML documents must start with a document type declaration: <code class="w3-codespan">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</code>.</p>
    <p>The HTML document itself begins with <code class="w3-codespan">&lt;html&gt;</code> and ends with <code class="w3-codespan">&lt;/html&gt;</code>.</p>
    <p>The visible part of the HTML document is between <code class="w3-codespan">&lt;body&gt;</code> and <code class="w3-codespan">&lt;/body&gt;</code>. </p>
    <p><b>Elements and Tags:</b> HTML uses predefined tags and elements which tell the browser how to properly display the content. Remember to include closing tags. If omitted, the browser applies the effect of the opening tag until the end of the page.</p>

    <p><b style="color:darkslategrey; font-size:22px;">The main parts of our element are as follows:</b><br>

        <i style="color:darkgreen; font-size:18px;">The opening tag:</i> This consists of the name of the element (in this case, p), wrapped in opening and closing angle brackets. This states where the element begins or starts to take effect — in this case where the paragraph begins.<br>
        <i style="color:darkgreen; font-size:18px;">The closing tag:</i> This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash before the element name. This states where the element ends — in this case where the paragraph ends. Failing to add a closing tag is one of the standard beginner errors and can lead to strange results.<br>
        <i style="color:darkgreen; font-size:18px;">The content:</i> This is the content of the element, which in this case, is just text.
        The element: The opening tag, the closing tag, and the content together comprise the element.</p>

    <p><b style="color:darkslategrey; font-size:22px;">Nesting elements</b><br>
        You can put elements inside other elements too — this is called nesting. If we wanted to state that our cat is very grumpy, we could wrap the word "very" in a < strong > element, which means that the word is to be strongly emphasized</p>

    <p><b style="color:darkslategrey; font-size:22px;">Void elements</b><br>
        Some elements have no content and are called void elements.<br> For example < img > element. This contains two attributes, but there is no closing < /img > tag and no inner content. This is because an image element doesn't wrap content to affect it. Its purpose is to embed an image in the HTML page in the place it appears.</p>

    <p><b style="color:darkslategrey; font-size:22px;">Anatomy of an HTML document</b><br> 
        <i style="color:darkgreen; font-size:18px;">< !DOCTYPE html ></i> —  It is a required preamble. In the mists of time, when HTML was young (around 1991/92), doctypes were meant to act as links to a set of rules that the HTML page had to follow to be considered good HTML, which could mean automatic error checking and other useful things. However, these days, they don't do much and are basically just needed to make sure your document behaves correctly. That's all you need to know for now.<br>
        <i style="color:darkgreen; font-size:18px;">< html >< /html ></i> — the < html > element. This element wraps all the content on the entire page and is sometimes known as the root element. It also includes the lang attribute, setting the primary language of the document.<br>
        <i style="color:darkgreen; font-size:18px;">< head>< /head></i> — the < head> element. This element acts as a container for all the stuff you want to include on the HTML page that isn't the content you are showing to your page's viewers. This includes things like keywords and a page description that you want to appear in search results, CSS to style our content, character set declarations, and more.<br>
        <i style="color:darkgreen; font-size:18px;">< title>< /title></i> — the < title> element. This sets the title of your page, which is the title that appears in the browser tab the page is loaded in. It is also used to describe the page when you bookmark/favorite it.<br>
        <i style="color:darkgreen; font-size:18px;">< body>< /body></i> — the < body> element. This contains all the content that you want to show to web users when they visit your page, whether that's text, images, videos, games, playable audio tracks, or whatever else.</p>
