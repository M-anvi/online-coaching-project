    <p><b style="color:darkslategrey; font-size:25px;">Why CSS?</b></p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>CSS saves time:</b> You can write CSS once and reuse the same sheet in multiple HTML pages.</li>
        <li><b>Easy Maintenance:</b> To make a global change simply change the style, and all elements in all the webpages will be updated automatically.</li>
        <li><b>Search Engines:</b> CSS is considered a clean coding technique, which means search engines wont have to struggle to “read” its content.</li>
        <li><b>Superior styles to HTML:</b> CSS has a much wider array of attributes than HTML, so you can give a far better look to your HTML page in comparison to HTML attributes.</li>
        <li><b>Offline Browsing:</b> CSS can store web applications locally with the help of an offline cache. Using this we can view offline websites.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><b style="color:darkslategrey; font-size:25px;">CSS Syntax:</b><br>

        CSS comprises style rules that are interpreted by the browser and then applied to the corresponding elements in your document. A style rule set consists of a selector and declaration block.<br>
        
        <b>Selector:</b> A selector in CSS is used to target and select specific HTML elements to apply styles to.<br>
        <b>Declaration:</b> A declaration in CSS is a combination of a property and its corresponding value.<br>
        Selector -- h1<br>
        Declaration -- {color:blue;font size:12px;} <br>
        The selector points to the HTML element you want to style.<br>
        The declaration block contains one or more declarations separated by semicolons.<br>
        Each declaration includes a CSS property name and a value, separated by a colon.</p>
